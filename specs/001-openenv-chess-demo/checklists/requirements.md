# Specification Quality Checklist: OpenEnv Multi-Agent Chess Demo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ PASSED - All Quality Checks

**Content Quality**: PASS
- Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of Python, FastAPI, specific libraries)
- Focuses on what users need and why they need it
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- All 30 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria include specific metrics (5 minutes, 95%, 500+ stars, etc.)
- Success criteria are user-focused (deployment time, crash rates, adoption metrics)
- All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 7 specific boundary conditions
- Scope is well-defined through user stories (P1-P5 priorities)
- Assumptions section clearly documents 8 key assumptions

**Feature Readiness**: PASS
- All 30 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 5 user stories cover complete user journey from first-time viewer to researcher
- Success criteria directly measure outcomes described in requirements
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent - Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P5) enables incremental delivery
- Each user story is independently testable as required
- Success criteria balance adoption, learning, performance, and community metrics
- Edge cases anticipate real failure scenarios
- Assumptions are realistic and well-documented

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES
- No clarifications needed from stakeholders
- Requirements are clear enough to begin technical planning
- Success criteria provide clear targets for implementation validation
- Can proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` command
