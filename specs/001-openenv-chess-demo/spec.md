## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: How should the system handle Hugging Face token authentication for model access? → A: Environment variable with documentation (HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN)
- Q: When an agent returns an illegal move, how should the system respond? → A: Retry with error feedback (up to 3 attempts), then fallback to random legal move
- Q: When an agent exceeds the 30-second timeout while deciding a move, what should happen? → A: Select random legal move and continue game with warning logged
- Q: When the WebSocket connection drops during an active game, how should the system handle reconnection? → A: Game continues server-side, client auto-reconnects and syncs to current state
- Q: When multiple game start requests arrive simultaneously, how should the system handle this? → A: Queue requests and process sequentially with status feedback to each client

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Start Demo Experience (Priority: P1)

A developer new to OpenEnv wants to see a working multi-agent system within 5 minutes to understand what OpenEnv can do and whether it's worth learning.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical first impression that determines whether developers continue exploring OpenEnv. Without this, users abandon before seeing any value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single setup command, opening a browser, and watching two agents play chess automatically. Delivers immediate understanding of multi-agent orchestration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has the demo repository, **When** they run the one-command setup, **Then** the chess game starts automatically within 5 minutes
2. **Given** the chess game is running, **When** agents make moves, **Then** the board updates in real-time with smooth animations
3. **Given** agents are playing, **When** the developer watches the game, **Then** they can see what each agent is "thinking" displayed in side panels
4. **Given** the game is in progress, **When** a developer reviews the interface, **Then** all moves are clearly visible in standard chess notation
5. **Given** the game completes, **When** it ends, **Then** the result (checkmate/stalemate/draw) is clearly displayed

### User Story 2 - Understanding Agent Behavior (Priority: P2)

A visual learner wants to observe how agents make decisions so they can understand the logic behind multi-agent systems and apply these patterns to their own projects.

**Why this priority**: Transparency into agent reasoning is what differentiates this from a simple chess game and makes it educational. This is the core learning value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by observing agent panels during gameplay - each move should show reasoning, confidence level, and thinking time without requiring code inspection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agents are playing, **When** an agent evaluates a move, **Then** their reasoning is displayed in plain language in their panel
2. **Given** an agent selects a move, **When** the move is made, **Then** confidence scores are shown as percentages
3. **Given** the board is in a position, **When** it's an agent's turn, **Then** all legal moves are visually highlighted on the board
4. **Given** an agent is deciding, **When** time elapses, **Then** the thinking time is displayed and updates in real-time
5. **Given** the game has history, **When** a user clicks on a previous move, **Then** the board shows that historical position

### User Story 3 - Documentation Learning Path (Priority: P3)

A developer learning OpenEnv wants to access documentation and code examples directly from the demo interface so they can transition from watching to building their own agents.

**Why this priority**: Bridges the gap between seeing the demo and building with OpenEnv. Essential for conversion from observer to builder.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking documentation links in the interface and verifying they lead to relevant, helpful content about OpenEnv integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the demo interface is open, **When** a user clicks "How It Works", **Then** architecture documentation opens explaining the OpenEnv integration
2. **Given** documentation is accessible, **When** a user views it, **Then** code examples are provided showing key OpenEnv methods
3. **Given** the demo is running, **When** a user looks for resources, **Then** links to the OpenEnv specification are clearly visible
4. **Given** a developer wants to experiment, **When** they access the documentation, **Then** instructions for local development setup are provided

---

### User Story 4 - Custom Agent Experimentation (Priority: P4)

An ML engineer wants to create and test their own chess agent with custom strategies to experiment with different agent behaviors and understand how to build agents.

**Why this priority**: Enables hands-on experimentation beyond just watching. Critical for researchers and advanced users who want to customize behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by modifying agent configuration files, restarting the game, and observing different playing styles without modifying core code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has access to agent configuration, **When** they modify system prompts, **Then** agent behavior changes accordingly
2. **Given** multiple agent configurations exist, **When** a developer selects different agents, **Then** the game uses those agent personalities
3. **Given** an agent configuration is modified, **When** the system reloads, **Then** changes take effect without full restart
4. **Given** different models are available, **When** a developer specifies a model, **Then** that model is used for agent decisions

---

### User Story 4.5 - Hugging Face Hub Integration (Priority: P4.5)

An ML researcher wants to share custom chess agents and environment configurations on Hugging Face Hub so the community can discover, use, and build upon their work.

**Why this priority**: Enables community sharing and collaboration. Critical for fostering an ecosystem around OpenEnv chess agents and making custom configurations discoverable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by publishing an environment to Hub, loading it in a new session, and verifying all functionality works via roundtrip save/load.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a custom environment configuration, **When** developer calls `save_pretrained()`, **Then** configuration is serialized to disk
2. **Given** a serialized environment, **When** developer calls `push_to_hub()`, **Then** it's published to Hugging Face Hub with proper metadata
3. **Given** a Hub repository ID, **When** developer calls `from_pretrained()`, **Then** environment loads with identical functionality
4. **Given** custom agent configurations, **When** developer publishes via `Agent.push_to_hub()`, **Then** agents are discoverable on Hub
5. **Given** a Hub agent repository, **When** developer loads via `Agent.from_hub()`, **Then** agent configuration works identically to original

---

### User Story 5 - Research Performance Analysis (Priority: P5)

A researcher wants to track agent performance metrics and export game data to evaluate different agent configurations and publish findings.

**Why this priority**: Enables serious research use cases and reproducible experiments. Important for academic adoption and credibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running multiple games, viewing statistics, and exporting game logs in standard format for external analysis.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple games have been played, **When** a researcher views statistics, **Then** win/loss/draw rates are displayed per agent
2. **Given** games are completed, **When** a researcher requests metrics, **Then** average move times are tracked and displayed
3. **Given** a game finishes, **When** a researcher exports the game, **Then** it's available in standard PGN format
4. **Given** experiments need reproducibility, **When** a researcher sets a random seed, **Then** the same game can be replayed exactly

### Edge Cases

- When an agent times out (>30s), system selects random legal move and logs warning, game continues
- When an agent returns an illegal move, system retries up to 3 times with error feedback, then uses random legal move
- When WebSocket connection drops, game continues server-side while client auto-reconnects and syncs to current state
- When multiple games requested simultaneously, system queues requests and processes sequentially with status feedback
- When users try to start a game before the previous one completes, the new request is queued (covered by FR-044)
- When agents produce no reasoning output, system displays default status message "Agent thinking..."
- When browser window is resized during an animated move, CSS transitions adapt gracefully without interruption
