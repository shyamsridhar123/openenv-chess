=== CHESS EVALUATION FRAMEWORK ===

**Fundamental Principles:**
1. **Material**: Value pieces appropriately (Pawn=1, Knight/Bishop=3, Rook=5, Queen=9). Avoid unnecessary losses.
2. **Center Control**: Dominate central squares (e4, e5, d4, d5) with pawns and pieces. The center is the key battleground.
3. **Development**: Activate pieces early - knights before bishops, castle within first 10 moves, connect rooks.
4. **King Safety**: Castle early, maintain pawn shield, avoid weaknesses around king. Never expose your king unnecessarily.
5. **Pawn Structure**: Avoid doubled/isolated pawns, create passed pawns, control key squares with pawn chains.
6. **Piece Activity**: Place pieces on active squares - knights on outposts, bishops on open diagonals, rooks on open files.

**Tactical Patterns to Recognize:**
- **Forks**: One piece attacks two or more enemy pieces simultaneously (especially knight forks)
- **Pins**: Piece cannot move without exposing higher-value piece behind it (absolute pin if king is behind)
- **Skewers**: Reverse pin - valuable piece forced to move, exposing lesser piece behind
- **Discovered Attacks**: Moving one piece reveals attack from another piece behind it
- **Double Attacks**: Simultaneously threatening two targets with different pieces
- **Removal of Defender**: Eliminate or deflect piece protecting key square/piece
- **Overloading**: Force opponent's piece to defend too many things at once
- **Back Rank Threats**: Exploit weak back rank with rook/queen invasions

**Phase-Specific Strategy ({game_phase.upper()}):**

Legal moves include: e5c6, e5d7, e5f7, ...

**Example 2 - Discovered Attack:**
Position: White bishop on b2 pinning Black queen on e5 to king on h8, White knight on d4
Legal moves include: d4f5, d4e6, d4c6, ...
Best move: d4f5 (knight moves with check, and bishop still attacks pinned queen - wins queen)

**Example 3 - Back Rank Mate Threat:**
Position: White rook on d1, Black king on g8 trapped by own pawns on f7, g7, h7
Legal moves include: d1d8, d1d7, a2a3, ...
Best move: d1d8 (rook to 8th rank delivers checkmate - king has no escape)

**Example 1 - Central Pawn Development:**

**Example 2 - Knight Development:**
Position: Early opening, center pawns placed, knights still on starting squares
Legal moves include: g1f3, g1h3, b1c3, b1a3, ...
Best move: g1f3 (develops knight to natural square, controls center, prepares castling)

**Example 3 - Castling for King Safety:**
Position: Middlegame, king still on e1, pieces developed, path clear to castle
Legal moves include: e1g1, f1e2, h1g1, d2d4, ...
